                            Programming languages are group of orders, instructions, and other syntax which are used in order to make a software
                            program. "High-level languages" are languages used by programmers to write a code where this code can be compiled into a
                            "low-level language" which can be recognized easily by the hardware of the computer. The main point of designing
                            high-level languages is to reduce the difficulty of reading and understanding it which makes the operation of writing
                            source code by the programmers using logical words and symbols is easy. For more clarification, words which are reserved
                            like (function, while, if, and else) are mainly used in the majority of programming languages, also symbols like (<,>,
                                ==, and !=) are considered as common operators. High-level languages are similar to each other which is considered
                                as a good point for the programmers as they can easily understand source code written in multiple languages.
                                <br>
                                C++, Java, Perl, and PHP are examples of high-level programming languages. Compiled languages like C++ and Java are
                                known by this name because in order to run the source code, it must be compiled first. On the other hand,
                                interpreted
                                languages like Perl and PHP are known by this name since that the source code can be run through an interpreter
                                instead
                                of being compiled. Compiled languages are used in creating the software of the applications while interpreted
                                languages
                                are used in running scripts such as the scripts used to produce content used in dynamic websites. Assembly and
                                machine
                                languages are low-level languages. Assembly language consists of a list containing basic instructions and it is
                                harder
                                than a high-level language in reading. In seldom situations, the programmer may decide to use an assembly language
                                in
                                order to code a basic program to make sure that it operates efficiently. The assembler can also be used in
                                converting an
                                assembly code into machine code. The machine code or the machine language consists of binary codes series that a
                                computer's CPU understood them easily. This means that the machine language is not designed so that the humans can
                                read
                                it.

                            <b>COBOL"1959":</b> Dr. Grace Murray Hopper invented this computer programming language that could be used on all
                            types of
                            computers, COBOL is an abbreviation for "COmmon Business Oriented Language". It is used in ATMs, telephone systems,
                            hospital, computers of governments, cars systems and signals used in traffic. Parts of COBOL source code have been used
                            in the movie "The Terminator" vision display.
                            <br><b>C"1972":</b> It was developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie. C may be considered as the first high-level
                            language. The
                            high-level computer programming language is more similar to human language and different from the machine code. Many
                            programmers wanted an operating system known as UNIX to be used on different types of computers, that’s why C was
                            created. Many other languages such as Ruby, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, and Python was affected by this programming
                            language.
                            <br><b>C++"1983":</b> It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, it is considered as an extension of the C language. This
                            language is
                            used widely in the world. Engines of games and software with high-performance like Adobe Photoshop are the field of
                            usage of C++. C++ is still used in most of the packaged software.
                            Python"1991": It was created by Guido Van Rossum. It is easier in reading and it succeeded in reducing the number of
                            code lines less than many other computer programming languages. The British comedy group Monty Python was the reason for
                            naming this programming language by this name. Python is used in writing many frameworks for popular sites such as
                            Instagram.
                            <br><b>Visual Basic"1991":</b> It was developed by Microsoft. Visual Basic can use a graphical user interface (GUI) that
                            allows
                            programmers to choose and change chunks of code that have been selected before in a drag-and-drop fashion.
                            <br><b>R"1993":</b> It was developed at Auckland University by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman in New Zealand. R is
                            named after the
                            initials of the developers. Statisticians and performers of different types of data analysis usually use R.
                            Java"1995": It was named at first as Oak where Sun Microsystems developed it. At first, it was created for boxes of
                            cables and hand-held devices, but later it was developed so it could be used in transferring information on the World
                            Wide Web. Ever device uses Java, from computers to smartphones to parking meters. It is being used by three billion
                            devices!
                            <br><b>Ruby"1995":</b> Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto made Ruby where he succeeded in combining parts of his favorite
                            programming
                            languages forming a new programming language of general-purpose that can do many programming objectives. It is
                            well-known in developing Web applications. The execution of Ruby code slow, but by using it the computer programmers can
                            quickly put together and activate a program.
                            <br><b>JavaScript"1995":</b> It was made by Brendan Eich in just 10 days. This language is usually used to improve many
                            of the
                            interactions of Web browser. Javascript is mainly used by every major website.
                            <br><b>C#"2000":</b> Microsoft developed it in order to merge the ability of computing of C++ with the simplicity of
                            Visual Basic.
                            C++ is the base for C#, but it is similar to Java in many ways. Most of Microsoft products use it where it mainly used
                            in the development of desktop applications.
                            <br><b>Swift"2014":</b> It was developed by Apple in order to replace C, C++, and Objective-C. Swift is characterized by
                            easy usage
                            and doesn't allow many mistakes. It is versatile and multilateral as it can be used in desktop, apps of mobile and cloud
                            services.

                            Computers have a great effect on the modern life of humans. These computers are run by using a computer program.
                            Computer programs are created by using programming languages, that’s why they are the foundation of all the luxury that
                            we feel. All programs that have been made are created by using these languages; rostering systems, virtual reality,
                            scheduling software, online games, anti-virus and so many other examples. Therefore mastering programming languages
                            leads to understanding the origin of all digital technology. Programming languages is the different types of expressions
                            and logical constructing rules whose aim is to generate repeated and organized tasks. They have great importance as they
                            allow creating different systems that serve tasks which is the same as the needs of users. There is a great diversity of
                            programming languages and these languages have different types of requirements; however, this variety consists of two
                            large groups, structured programming languages and object-oriented languages. In computer science, everything used is
                            largely due to programming languages.
                            <br>
                            Computers can make many calculation operations rapidly; however, if these benefits weren't for the programs that run on
                            it, it will be totally useless. These programs are divided into different types, in the presence of the operating system
                            as the most important thing which is the system on which the different applications are activated. Programming languages
                            are essential in the development of these programs where each type has its specific characteristics to be implemented.
                            In addition, in order to allow various responses to existing requirements, each programming language is created in turn
                            with a lower level. For more clarification, each program is made in a clear path; complex solutions follow the simple
                            solutions and so on, following the path that is created to the improved requirements. The science of programming
                            languages is like any other science that comes from a simple understanding. As we have said before, there are two types
                            of programming languages: structured programming and object oriented programming. The structured programming language
                            consists of a group of instructions and orders and also a group of application rules such as the propositional logic, it
                            plays an essential role in this case where all processes can be subject to logical relationships. On the other hand, in
                            the case of an object-oriented programming language, there is an intention to reflect in the language various
                            circumstances of actual existence; therefore, reference will be created to objects, classes, inheritances, attributes,
                            etc. Programming languages also consists of interpreted and compiled languages; the interpreted language must be
                            explained by another program, while the compiled language must be translated by using a compiler, during creating a file
                            in this process which is known as executable.
                            If you know how to use programming language, you will be able to develop capacities in terms of problem solving and
                            objective automation. Certainly this type of skills coupled with some basic expressions and concepts of algorithms
